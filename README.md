# Power-BI-Analysis-of-Spotify-Songs-Trends-Insights-and-Popularity-Metrics
This project involves analyzing Spotify song data using Power BI to uncover trends, insights, and metrics related to song popularity, genres, and artist performance.
To effectively showcase your Power BI analysis of Spotify songs as a project, you should include the following key elements:

### Objective
   The objective of this project is to explore the Spotify song dataset to identify trends in song popularity, analyze genre distributions, and understand the attributes that contribute to a song's success.

### Data Source
  The dataset was sourced from Spotify's API and includes attributes such as song title, artist, genre, popularity score, release date, and various song characteristics.

### Tools and Technologies Used
     This analysis was conducted using Power BI for data visualization and Python for data extraction and cleaning.

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
    Data was cleaned by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing text fields. Additional calculated columns, such as `Year` and `Genre_Category`, were created for more detailed analysis.

### Key Visualizations and Dashboards
      Overview Dashboard: Shows key metrics like total number of songs, average popularity, top genres, and top artists.
      Song Attributes Dashboard: Visualizes relationships between song attributes like danceability, energy, tempo, and valence using scatter plots and histograms.
      Time Series Dashboard: Displays trends in song popularity and genre popularity over time with line and area charts.

### Insights and Analysis
    The analysis revealed that pop and hiphop are the most popular genres on Spotify, with a noticeable increase in danceable tracks over the past decade. Additionally, songs with higher energy levels tend to have higher popularity scores.

### Challenges and Solutions
    Example: One challenge was dealing with missing data for some song attributes. This was addressed by using mean imputation for numerical fields and mode imputation for categorical fields.

### Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a song's success on Spotify, which can be leveraged by artists and producers to optimize their content for maximum reach and engagement.

### Future Work
  Future work could include incorporating listener demographic data to understand audience preferences better and expanding the dataset to include more recent songs for a current trend analysis.
